## Project Description
This project showcases a responsive website for the Gosling Hotel, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes information about the hotel, its amenities, and a booking system that simulates the ability to make online reservations for users.

**Note**: The website is in Polish, and it is a student project developed as part of a learning process.

## Features
1. **Responsiveness**: The website is designed using Bootstrap to ensure full responsiveness across various devices.
2. **Booking Form**: A comprehensive booking form including text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, a selection list, and standard buttons. The form is validated both in HTML and JavaScript.
3. **Error Messages**: Clear and readable error messages are displayed when incorrect data is entered.
4. **Local Storage**: The data entered into the form is saved in local storage. This data can be displayed, modified, and deleted through the application interface.
5. **Asynchronous Content Loading**: Selected sections of the website are modified using content loaded asynchronously from server files via the Fetch API.
